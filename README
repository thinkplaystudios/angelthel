Using Angelscript with Esenthel
===============================

1. Compiling Angelscript
------------------------

First, get the source code from http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/

Create a static library with angelscript. Angelscript also
provides a lot of addons which can be useful. Because of the nature
of the esenthel editor, it is easier to compile these with the library.

This can be done by adding all addon code to the angelscript project in MSVC.

After compiling, put the library, along with angelscript.h in an easy to reach
directory. I'll use C:/angelscript as an example. You should also put the header
files of the addon's in there.

2. create a wrapper header file
-------------------------------
Copy the file angelscript_wrapper.h to C:/angelscript

3. Add Angelscript to your project
----------------------------------

Open the application properties and add:

Include Libraries  : C:\angelscript\angelscript.lib
Include Directories: C:\angelscript
Include Headers    : C:\angelscript\angelscript_wrapper.h

The example project already has these includes, but you might want to double check
the path. 

To use this in your own project, copy the green angelscript library folder to your project.
